# Web-Us-Ecommerce
This project is a web store application, with full user and admin functionality. 
I created this using MERN, MongoDB, Express, React and Node. This store also uses redux for scalable state management.
Following along with different tutorials, I created this, since I had never created a large scale piece of software and was interested in pushing myself. While also learning react as a frontend framework

Frameworks used
Express.js
ExpressAsyncHandler
Mongoose
React
React Redux
React Hooks
JWT
Dotenv

Running this program
clone the repo and in each folder (./backend, ./frontend) run npm install to get all the missing packages
then in the root directory run npm start to start the backend
in frontend run npm start to run the frontend

if all goes well, you should see a landing page, with a list of products
